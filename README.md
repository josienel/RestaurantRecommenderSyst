# RestaurantRecommenderSyst
Finding a restaurant that aligns with one's taste preferences, particularly in unfamiliar cities, poses a challenging task for travelers. This study addresses a persistent query that confronts travelers exploring new destinations: where should we dine? Leveraging data from TripAdvisor and incorporating information from restaurants in 31 of Europe's largest cities, our system is designed to simplify the restaurant selection process for tourists. Our recommender system is intricately developed, taking into account pivotal factors such as cuisine type, location, price range, and rating. This approach ensures the provision of personalized restaurant recommendations tailored to the specific preferences of individual travelers. Conducting a thorough comparative analysis of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models, we finalized our recommender system through a comprehensive evaluation. This ensures its capability to suggest the perfect restaurant based on the nuanced preferences of travelers. In essence, this research not only alleviates a significant pain point for tourists but also contributes a valuable tool to enhance their overall travel experience in European cities.
